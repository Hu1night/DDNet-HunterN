#mega_add_map mapname tag

# add submap with tag
# you can use "add_tagged_map_vote"(room config) to add submap by tag
# tag means what mode can use the submaps

# tag(you ban change it lol) :
# 1 = dm (has pickup but no team spawner)
# 2 = tdm (has pickup and team spawner)
# 4 = ctf (tdm + flag spawner)
# lms/lts/zCatch will ignore pickup spawner
# 8 = lms (no pickup and no team spawner)
# 16 = lts (no pickup but has team spawner)
# 32 = idk (lts + flag spawner)

# example: mega_add_map hunter2 31
# tag = dm + tdm + ctf + lms + lts = 1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + 16 = 31

# example: mega_add_map tdm1 27
# tag = dm + tdm + lms + lts = 1 + 2 + 8 + 16 = 27

# example: mega_add_map dm1 9
# tag = dm + lms + = 1 + 8 = 27
